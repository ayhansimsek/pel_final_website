            <p>
                The subsidy percentage is calculated based on your Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI). For incomes up to $80,000, the subsidy is 90%. For incomes between $80,000 and $530,000, the subsidy decreases by 1% for every additional $5,000 in income. Families with an ATI of $530,000 or more are not eligible for any subsidy.
